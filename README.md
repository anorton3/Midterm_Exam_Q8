Using your choice of a geospatial API, create a web map that visualizes at least two datasets of your choice and includes an analysis component:

1. choose at least two datasets with relevant data points on topics of interest , describe each dataset in a short paragraph, explaining their significance and how they relate to each other. 

2. Create JSON objects based on your chosen datasets. 

3. Place markers on the map using the data from your JSON objects. Each marker should correspond to a data point from your datasets. For each marker, create a popup that displays the location name and other data fields from the JSON object.

4. Perform analyses or visualizations using both datasets, choose the analysis methods that best suite your datasets and clearly explain your approach and findings in a short paragraph.

5. Add layer controls that allows users to toggle between several layers, and switch between different tile layers (e.g., satellite view, street view)
